# The-Gaming-Room
  The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to make a software application titled "Draw it or Lose it" in which teams compete to guess what the image is on screen within 30 seconds. If the first cannot guess the picture in time, the other teams will then have the ability to guess the image to earn points.
   When working on the project, I found that making sure to ellote enough time to work was one of the more beneficial tactics. This was especially useful to make sure I would work on the code while having enough time to debug and fix any errors that were present. I made sure to make my documentation clear and easy to understand for the client to be able to easily comprehend the choices made when working on the project.
